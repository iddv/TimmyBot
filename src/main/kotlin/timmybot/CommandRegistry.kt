/**
 * Command Registry - Phase 1 Complete
 * 
 * EXPLANATION FOR USER: You asked why you need to register commands manually.
 * The answer is: YOU DON'T! If you already see 3 commands in Discord, they're already registered.
 * 
 * Discord slash commands have TWO parts:
 * 1. REGISTRATION: Telling Discord "these commands exist" (already done for you)
 * 2. HANDLING: Your bot responding when someone uses them (what we built in Phase 1)
 * 
 * You already have #1 done (that's why you see 3 commands)
 * We built #2 (your bot can now respond to /ping)
