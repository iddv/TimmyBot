    - Legal violations (ToS breaches)
    - No access to premium features
    - Ads and quality restrictions
    - Single point of failure

TimmyBot Model:
  User Account → Music Service API → Bot → User
  Benefits:
    - User's own premium features
    - No ToS violations (user authenticates)
    - No bot rate limits (uses user quotas)
    - Premium quality and features
    - Legal compliance
```
